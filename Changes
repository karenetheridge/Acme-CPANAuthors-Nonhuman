          - author data is now generated using the 00whois.xml document,
            rather than 01mailrc.txt, to get non-asciified author names

          - further simplified the build templating code, to take advantage of
            new features of [MungeFile::WithData]
          - added tooltip for each avatar image, providing PAUSE id, name, and
            number of distributions

0.006     2013-08-16 05:32:38Z
          - proper fix for html image spacing (for real this time?)
          - split off file munging code (run at build time) into its own

          - use new Acme::CPANAuthors::Factory
          - fixed prereqs, to allow operation on 5.8.x (build requires is not
            the same thing as develop requires)

          - rewrite code and HTML generation by using embedded templates in
            the .pm file and authors in __DATA__, and a custom Dist::Zilla
            plugin
          - updated list of PAUSE IDs, by re-scanning cpan-faces

0.002     2013-06-01 17:04:26Z
