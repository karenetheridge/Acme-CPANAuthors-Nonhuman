=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::CPANAuthors;
    use Acme::CPANAuthors::Nonhuman;

    my $authors = Acme::CPANAuthors->new('Nonhuman');
    my $number   = $authors->count;
    my @ids      = $authors->id;
    my @distros  = $authors->distributions('ETHER');
    my $url      = $authors->avatar_url('MITHALDU');
    my $kwalitee = $authors->kwalitee('GAURAV');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a hash of PAUSE IDs and names of non-human CPAN authors.
On the internet, no one knows you're a cat (unless your avatar gives it away)!

The original list of authors was determined via
L<The Faces of CPAN|http://hexten.net/cpan-faces/>.

=for stopwords programmatically

I wrote this module initially as a reaction to a previous L<Acme::CPANAuthors>
distribution that inappropriately highlighted a particular demographic (it has
now since been deleted).  Then, I realized that so much of the content I
wanted to include in this module could be programmatically generated, so I
continued on as an exercise in templating code at build time using raw data in
the C<__DATA__> section.  That support code has since been split off into its
own distribution, L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MungeFile::WithData>.

=head1 SUPPORT

=for stopwords irc

Bugs may be submitted through L<the RT bug tracker|https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Acme-CPANAuthors-Nonhuman>
(or L<bug-Acme-CPANAuthors-Nonhuman@rt.cpan.org|mailto:bug-Acme-CPANAuthors-Nonhuman@rt.cpan.org>).
I am also usually active on irc, as 'ether' at C<irc.perl.org>.

It may well be the case that some of the authors listed here are B<not>
actually non-human, in which case this absolutely must be reported immediately
so this module can be corrected! We of the furry and clawed will not stand for
imposters in our midst.

On the other hand, occasionally new brothers and sisters join the Perl family
and are not recognized here -- please let me know so they can be added to the
list.
